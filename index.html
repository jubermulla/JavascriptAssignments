    <h3> Q.8 Whats the difference between window vs document? <br>
        <p>window is the global object you can reference any properties of it with just the property name - so you do not have to write down window. <br>
            Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, also can be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.
            It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. <br>
            It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser. <br>
            It is the object of the browser. <br>
            syntax:
            window.propertyname;
        </p>
        <p>Document is the main object of the potentially visible document object model/DOM. <br>
            What about the document object then? The Document object(DOM) is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc
            It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser. <br>
            It is loaded inside the window. <br>
            It is the object of window property. <br>
            syntax:
            document.propertyname;
        </p>
